# Introduction to Cloud-Native

-----

## Summary

Cloud-native refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. They can achieve this goal by using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers. In addition to scale, an organization needs to be agile in integrating customer feedback and adapting to the surrounding technology ecosystem.

*Containers* are closely associated with cloud-native terminology. Containers are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. 
The main characteristics of containers are easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover. As such, often, a microservice-based architecture is chosen in tandem with cloud-native tooling.
Microservices are used to manage and configure a collection of small,
independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

## Stackholders

--------------------

An engineering team can use cloud-native tooling to enable quick delivery of value to customers and easily extend to new features and technologies. These are the main reasons why an organization needs to adopt cloud-native technologies. However, when trialing cloud-native tooling, there are two main perspectives to address: business and technical stakeholders.

*From a business perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:*

- Agility - perform strategic transformations
- Growth - quickly iterate on customer feedback
- Service availability - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7
- From a technical perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

- Automation - release a service without human intervention
- Orchestration - introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
- Observability - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component
