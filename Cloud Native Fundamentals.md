# Introduction to Cloud-Native

-----

## Summary

Cloud-native refers to the set of practices that empowers an organization to build and manage applications at scale. They can achieve this goal by using private, hybrid, or public cloud providers. In addition to scale, an organization needs to be agile in integrating customer feedback and adapting to the surrounding technology ecosystem.

*Containers* are closely associated with cloud-native terminology. Containers are used to run a single application with all required dependencies. 
The main characteristics of containers are easy to manage, deploy, and fast to recover. As such, often, a microservice-based architecture is chosen in tandem with cloud-native tooling.
Microservices are used to manage and configure a collection of small,
independent services that can be easily packaged and executed within a container.

## Stackholders

--------------------

An engineering team can use cloud-native tooling to enable quick delivery of value to customers and easily extend to new features and technologies. These are the main reasons why an organization needs to adopt cloud-native technologies. However, when trialing cloud-native tooling, there are two main perspectives to address: business and technical stakeholders.

*From a business perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:*

- Agility - perform strategic transformations
- Growth - quickly iterate on customer feedback
- Service availability - ensures the product is available to customers 24/7
- From a technical perspective, the adoption of cloud-native tooling represents:

- Automation - release a service without human intervention
- Orchestration - introduce a container orchestrator to manage thousands of services with minimal effort
- Observability - ability to independently troubleshoot and debug each component

------------------


Before building an application, it is common to go through a design phase to identify the main requirements and structure of an application. In correlation with the available resources, a team will choose the most suitable project architecture.

In the industry, usually, the two main approaches that are usually referenced are monoliths and microservices. In this lesson, we will explore each architectural model and the implied trade-offs. As well, we will cover good development practices to be considered if an application is targeted for containerization. These practices are valid for both monolith and microservice architectures.

# Design Considerations for Cloud-Native Applications

When building an application it is important to allocate time for context discovery. This includes listing all necessary functionalities of the application and enumerating any resources that can enable its buildout. This phase sets the fundamentals of the project. If properly implemented, it can enable the creation of services that are scalable, resilient, and extensible.

The first step in the context discovery process is to list the functional requirements, or what application capabilities should deliver to the end-users. For example, a good starting point is to expand on the following:

- Stakeholders
- Functionalities
- End users
- Input and output process
- Engineering teams
- The second step is to enumerate the available resources that facilitates the implementation of the project. For example, a good starting point is to list available:

- Engineering resources
- Financial resources
- Timeframes
- Internal knowledge
- Having a good understanding of functional requirements and available resources can lead to a simpler choice between monolithic and microservice-based architectures.

# Monoliths and Microservices

Prior to an organization delivers a product, the engineering team needs to decide on the most suitable application architecture. In most of the cases 2 distinct models are referenced: monoliths and microservices. Regardless of the adopted structure, the main goal is to design an application that delivers value to customers and can be easily adjusted to accommodate new functionalities.

Also, each architecture encapsulates the 3 main tires of an application:

UI (User Interface) - handles HTTP requests from the users and returns a response
Business logic - contained the code that provides a service to the users
Data layer - implements access and storage of data objects
Monoliths
In a monolithic architecture, application tiers can be described as:

part of the same unit
managed in a single repository
sharing existing resources (e.g. CPU and memory)
developed in one programming language
released using a single binary

Imagine a team develops a booking application using a monolithic approach. In this case, the UI is the website that the user interacts with. The business logic contains the code that provides the booking functionalities, such as search, booking, payment, and so on. These are written using one programming language (e.g. Java or Go) and stored in a single repository. The data layer contains functions that store and retrieve customer data. All of these components are managed as a unit, and the release is done using a single binary.

##### Microservices
In a microservice architecture, application tiers are managed independently, as different units. Each unit has the following characteristics:

managed in a separate repository
own allocated resources (e.g. CPU and memory)
well-defined API (Application Programming Interface) for connection to other units
implemented using the programming language of choice
released using its own binary

Now, let's imagine the team develops a booking application using a microservice approach.

--------------------------


In this case, the UI remains the website that the user interacts with. However, the business logic is split into smaller, independent units, such as login, payment, confirmation, and many more. These units are stored in separate repositories and are written using the programming language of choice (e.g. Go for the payment service and Python for login service). To interact with other services, each unit exposes an API. And lastly, the data layer contains functions that store and retrieve customer and order data. As expected, each unit is released using its own binary.

##### New terms

*Monolith:* application design where all application tiers are managed as a single unit
*Microservice:* application design where application tiers are managed as independent, smaller units
